# Skip security warnings that are expected in this application:
# B101 - assert_used: Expected in test files and development code
# B103 - set_bad_file_permissions: chmod 0o755 is needed for executable scripts
# B311 - random: Standard random is fine for non-cryptographic purposes (temp filenames)
# B404 - subprocess_import: subprocess module is needed for system integration
# B603 - subprocess_without_shell_equals_true: Controlled subprocess calls are safe
# B605 - start_process_with_a_shell: Needed for shell command execution
# B607 - start_process_with_partial_path: Using system PATH is expected behavior
