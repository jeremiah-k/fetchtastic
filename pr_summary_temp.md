# Fix prerelease downloading and add dynamic device pattern matching

## Overview

This PR addresses a bug where prerelease files were not being downloaded despite directories being created, and adds dynamic device pattern matching using the Meshtastic API.

## Changes Made

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed prerelease download functionality**: Modified `check_for_prereleases` to track existing files that match criteria, not just newly downloaded files
- **Fixed pattern matching for prereleases**: Changed from chip-based patterns (`SELECTED_FIRMWARE_ASSETS`) to device-based patterns (`EXTRACT_PATTERNS`) to match actual prerelease file naming
- **Fixed input validation crashes**: Added try/catch blocks for integer input in setup wizard to prevent crashes on invalid input
- **Fixed mutable cache leak**: Return copy of device patterns set to prevent external mutation
- **Fixed regex false positives**: Improved device pattern matching to prevent patterns like 'r-' from incorrectly matching 'firmware'
- **Fixed stale directory handling**: Refresh directory list during prerelease cleanup to avoid operating on removed directories

### New Features

- **Dynamic device pattern matching**: Added `DeviceHardwareManager` class that fetches device patterns from Meshtastic API
- **API caching system**: Implements 24-hour cache with graceful fallback to expired cache when API unavailable
- **Prerelease version tracking**: Added JSON-based tracking of prerelease versions with commit hashes and file counts
- **Enhanced setup wizard**: Improved exclude pattern configuration with recommended defaults and retry capability
- **Configurable prerelease cleanup**: Automatically removes old prerelease versions while keeping latest

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Refactored tracking functions**: Eliminated code duplication in prerelease tracking data readers
- **Improved exception handling**: Changed from broad `except Exception` to specific exception types where appropriate
- **Performance optimizations**: Optimized commit tracking from O(nÂ²) to O(n) complexity
- **Better error messages**: Removed inappropriate cultural terms from user-facing error messages
- **Enhanced logging**: Added structured logging for prerelease operations and device pattern matching

### Configuration Changes

- **Version bump**: Updated package version from 0.6.7 to 0.7.0
- **Python requirements**: Added `python_requires = >=3.8` for walrus operator support
- **New configuration options**: Added device hardware API settings and exclude pattern defaults
- **LOG_LEVEL support**: CLI now honors LOG_LEVEL setting from config file

### Testing Additions

- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Added 2,656 lines of new tests covering prerelease workflows, device pattern matching, caching, error handling, and UI scenarios
- **Edge case testing**: Added tests for API failures, cache corruption, permission errors, and invalid input scenarios
- **Integration testing**: Added end-to-end tests for complete prerelease download workflows

## Technical Details

### Device Hardware Manager

- Fetches device data from `https://api.meshtastic.org/resource/deviceHardware`
- Caches responses for 24 hours with automatic expiration
- Falls back to hardcoded patterns when API unavailable
- Validates URL schemes to prevent SSRF attacks
- Handles network errors and malformed responses gracefully

### Prerelease Tracking

- Tracks prerelease versions with JSON files containing commit hashes and metadata
- Displays prerelease count since last major release
- Automatically cleans up old prerelease directories
- Supports both new JSON format and legacy text format for backward compatibility

### Pattern Matching

- Device patterns (e.g., 'rak4631-') match all file types for that device
- File type patterns (e.g., 'device-', 'bleota') use exact substring matching
- Special handling for 'littlefs-' pattern to match filesystem files
- Case-insensitive matching for better user experience

## Statistics

- **74 commits** addressing the original issue and subsequent improvements
- **+4,563 lines, -184 lines** across 13 files
- **371 tests passing** with 69.77% coverage
- **Zero regressions** in existing functionality

This PR transforms the prerelease download system from a basic directory scanner to a comprehensive tracking and management system while maintaining backward compatibility and adding future-proof device pattern detection.
