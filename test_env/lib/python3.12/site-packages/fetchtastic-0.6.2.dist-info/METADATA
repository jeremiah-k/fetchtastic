## Installation

### Linux/Mac Installation

#### Easy Installation (Recommended)

1. **Run the Installer Script**:

   Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.sh | bash
```

The script installs Python if needed (on macOS, it will install Homebrew if needed), installs pipx, installs Fetchtastic, and runs the Fetchtastic setup.

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

```bash
# Using pipx (recommended)
pipx install fetchtastic

# Or using pip
pip install fetchtastic
```

### Windows Installation

Fetchtastic can be installed on Windows systems with enhanced Windows integration.

#### Easy Windows Installation (Recommended)

This must be run in PowerShell (not Command Prompt).

1. **Run the Installer Script**:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.ps1 | iex
```

The script installs Python if needed, installs pipx, installs Fetchtastic with Windows integration, and runs the Fetchtastic setup.

#### Manual Windows Installation

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Install pipx and Fetchtastic**:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

Restart PowerShell, then run:

```powershell
pipx install "fetchtastic[win]"
fetchtastic setup
```

This installs Fetchtastic with Windows integration features (Start Menu shortcuts, configuration file shortcuts, and Windows startup integration).

#### Windows Integration Features

When you run `fetchtastic setup` on Windows with the Windows integration dependencies installed, you'll get:

- Shortcuts in the Start Menu for common operations (download, setup, repo browse)
- A shortcut to check for and install Fetchtastic updates
- A shortcut to the configuration file for easy editing
- A shortcut to the Meshtastic downloads folder
- Option to run Fetchtastic automatically at Windows startup

### Termux Installation (Android)

Fetchtastic can also be installed on your Android device using Termux.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Termux**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
2. **Install Termux Boot**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.boot/)
3. **Install Termux API**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/)
4. _(Optional)_ **Install ntfy**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/)

#### Installation (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.sh | bash
```

This script will:

- Install Python and pipx
- Install Fetchtastic via pipx for better package isolation
- Run the setup process

#### Manual Termux Installation

**Using pipx (recommended):**

```bash
# Install required packages
pkg install python python-pip openssl -y

# Install pipx
pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# Install Fetchtastic
pipx install fetchtastic

# Run setup
fetchtastic setup
```

**Using pip (legacy method):**

```bash
# Install required packages
pkg install python python-pip openssl -y

# Install Fetchtastic
pip install fetchtastic

# Run setup
fetchtastic setup
```

**Note:** If you have an existing pip installation, Fetchtastic will offer to migrate you to pipx during setup for better package isolation and consistency with other platforms.

## Upgrading

To upgrade Fetchtastic to the latest version:

### Windows (Recommended)

#### Option 1: Use the installation script (handles upgrade issues automatically)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.ps1 | iex
```

#### Option 2: Use Start Menu shortcut

- Open Start Menu → Fetchtastic → "Check for Updates"

#### Option 3: Manual pipx upgrade

```powershell
pipx upgrade fetchtastic
# If it says "already at latest version" but you know there's a newer version:
pipx install fetchtastic[win] --force
```

### Linux/Mac (pipx installations)

```bash
pipx upgrade fetchtastic
```

### Termux (Android)

**pipx installation (recommended):**

```bash
pipx upgrade fetchtastic
```

**pip installation (legacy):**

```bash
pip install --upgrade fetchtastic
```

**Migration from pip to pipx:**
If you have an existing pip installation and want to migrate to pipx:

```bash
fetchtastic setup
# Follow the migration prompts, or manually:
pip uninstall fetchtastic -y
pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install fetchtastic
```

### Troubleshooting Upgrades

If `pipx upgrade` reports "already at latest version" but you know a newer version exists:

**Windows:**

```powershell
pipx install fetchtastic[win] --force
```

**Linux/Mac/Termux:**

```bash
pipx install fetchtastic --force
```

**Complete reinstall (if needed):**

```bash
pipx uninstall fetchtastic
pipx install fetchtastic[win]  # Windows
pipx install fetchtastic       # Linux/Mac/Termux
```
