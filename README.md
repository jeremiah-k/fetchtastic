## Installation

### Linux/Mac Installation

#### Easy Installation (Recommended)

1. **Run the Installer Script**:

   Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.sh | bash
```

The script installs Python if needed (on macOS, it will install Homebrew if needed), installs pipx, installs Fetchtastic, and runs the Fetchtastic setup.

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

```bash
# Using pipx (recommended)
pipx install fetchtastic

# Or using pip
pip install fetchtastic
```

### Windows Installation

Fetchtastic can be installed on Windows systems with enhanced Windows integration.

#### Easy Installation (Recommended)

This must be run in PowerShell (not Command Prompt).

1. **Run the Installer Script**:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremiah-k/fetchtastic/main/src/fetchtastic/tools/setup_fetchtastic.ps1 | iex
```

The script installs Python if needed, installs pipx, installs Fetchtastic with Windows integration, and runs the Fetchtastic setup.

#### Manual Installation

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Install pipx and Fetchtastic**:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

Restart PowerShell, then run:

```powershell
pipx install "fetchtastic[win]"
fetchtastic setup
```

This installs Fetchtastic with Windows integration features (Start Menu shortcuts, configuration file shortcuts, and Windows startup integration).

#### Windows Integration Features

When you run `fetchtastic setup` on Windows with the Windows integration dependencies installed, you'll get:

- Shortcuts in the Start Menu for common operations (download, setup, repo browse)
- A shortcut to check for and install Fetchtastic updates
- A shortcut to the configuration file for easy editing
- A shortcut to the Meshtastic downloads folder
- Option to run Fetchtastic automatically at Windows startup

### Termux Installation (Android)

Fetchtastic can also be installed on your Android device using Termux.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Termux**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
2. **Install Termux Boot**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.boot/)
3. **Install Termux API**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/)
4. _(Optional)_ **Install ntfy**: [From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/)

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pkg install python python-pip openssl -y
```

#### Install Fetchtastic

```bash
pip install fetchtastic
```

You can use `pipx` in Termux, but `pip` is usually simpler and works well.

## Upgrading

### On Linux/Mac/Windows (pipx installations)

```bash
pipx upgrade fetchtastic
```

### On Termux (pip installation)

```bash
pip install --upgrade fetchtastic
```
